## Changes

* implemented horizontal and vertical speed for sprites

* Formatted

## To-Do:

* Clean up imports, unecessary code, and comments

* Don't rely on escape characters to clear the screen, try and leverage `crossterm` to refresh the screen

* Make a final game animation

* Fix speedster bullets

* Perhaps add sound
